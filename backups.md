# Backups

This section is meant to provide information if you've purchased VTL (Virtual Tape Library) with your Litmis Spaces IBM i partition.

## Object/Library Restoration 
is self-service via BRMS (IBM Backup, Recovery and Media Services) and all virtual backup tapes are online so as long as proper backups were performed against the object/library, restoration is available.  

Let us know if you need help with these steps.
 
## System Recovery 
This requires a notification to Litmis Support (team@litmis.com). Also, periodic full system backups must have been performed prior to any system recovery requests.  Detailed BRMS recovery reports should be kept and provided to identify virtual tape volume to be used for such recovery purposes.

# Purchase Backups
If don't have backups and you'd like to purchase them, please contact team@litmis.com
